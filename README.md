# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains solution to many of the
popular algorithms and data structures related problems.

Each problem has explanations and multiple solutions.

## Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can
be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data
values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to
the data.

## Algorithms

An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is
a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.

## Testing

- Testing is done using Jest.
- `npm test` to run the tests.
