# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains solution to many of the popular algorithms and data structures related problems.

Each problem has explanations and multiple solutions.

Problems are solved in multiple languages like JavaScript, Python and GO.

## Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can
be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data
values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to
the data.

## Algorithms

An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is
a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.
