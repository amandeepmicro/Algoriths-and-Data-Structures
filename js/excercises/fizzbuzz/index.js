/* --- Directions
Write a program that console logs the numbers
from 1 to n. But for multiples of three print
“fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples
of five print “buzz”. For numbers which are multiples
of both three and five print “fizzbuzz”.
--- Example
  fizzBuzz(5);
  1
  2
  fizz
  4
  buzz */

// 1st solution
function fizzBuzz1(n) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (i % 15 === 0) {
      console.log("fizzbuzz");
    } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
      console.log("buzz");
    } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
      console.log("fizz");
    } else {
      console.log(i);
    }
  }
}
/*

The order of events in conditional loops does matter. When the loops begins, if will check if i % 3 === 0 in your code first and if that condition is met, it will move on to the next iteration. So, in your case, when we get to n=15 (which should be the first "fizzbuzz", your i % 3 === 0 condition will be met before it even gets a chance to check if it also meets the i % 5 === 0 condition so it will log "fizz" instead of "fizzbuzz". If you make (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) the first condition, 15 would evaluate to "fizzbuzz" and would not proceed to check them individually in the else statements.

// 2nd solution
function fizzBuzz2(n) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    const fizz = i % 3 === 0 ? "fizz" : "";
    const buzz = i % 5 === 0 ? "buzz" : "";
    console.log(fizz + buzz || i);
  }
}
/* 
    Here with each iteration i increments and then fizz and buzz stores string , then we console.log() the result or i itself
